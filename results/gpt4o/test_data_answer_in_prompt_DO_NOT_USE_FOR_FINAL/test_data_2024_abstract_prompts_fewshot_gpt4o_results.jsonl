The proposal of the Modified Silhouette Score (MSS) for assessing graph quality is innovative and well-justified through theoretical analysis. The experimental setup is diverse, including both synthetic and real-world graphs, which strengthens the validation of their approach.", "Weaknesses": "The main weakness comes from the potential limitations of MSS in some scenarios, particularly if the assumptions underlying the modified score do not fully apply across various types of graphs.
